This is a Readme file that outlines the procedure to use the psocluster program.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The program for the implementation of the cluster based PSO for Software Effort estimation is in psocluster.c .
  The input is taken from the cocomo81 dataset.
  The sample 45 values on which the program was tested is given in psocluster_ip .
  The output file that we obtained is given in psocluster_op.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To test the program on more data sets, change the val variable in the psocluster.c program.
Change it to the number of values you want to enter.
The values should be entered in the format of:

size measuredeffort eaf

Also based on the values the ranges of velocities of va,vb,vc should be modified in the functions init, updatea , updateb and updatec .

The number of iterations can be varied by changing the noi variable in the init() function ( default taken as 1000).
The number of particles can be varied by changing the nop variable in the init() function (default taken as 20).
To assign different number of clusters ( default taken as 3 clusters) change the variable kmeans in the global variable declaration.
